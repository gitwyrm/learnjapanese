# Learn Japanese app

A simple React web application to learn Japanese, currently in development.

It's a single page application, so runs fully client side in the web browser, no server side component.

## Status
Development started March 16th 2025

Right now, there are two simple quizzes: one for Hiragana and one for Katakana. You are shown a Japanese symbol and given three choices in romaji.

If you click the right button, it turns green, and the symbol is spoken using Japanese Text-to-Speech (TTS) built into the web browser to better reinforce which option is correct and also to help you learn the pronunciation.

## Start dev server
npm run dev
